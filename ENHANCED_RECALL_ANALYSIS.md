# 🧠 ULTRATHINK: Enhanced Recall System

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

With our **AMAZING** enhanced hooks now capturing sophisticated context with rich metadata, we needed the recall system to be equally intelligent to:

1. **Avoid Context Overload** - Don't dump everything at once
2. **Prioritize Intelligently** - Insights > Commits > Prompts
3. **Understand Rich Metadata** - Use the sophisticated tags from enhanced hooks
4. **Adapt to Current Work** - Surface relevant context for what you're doing now
5. **Manage Token Limits** - Stay within Claude's context window effectively

## 🚀 Enhanced Recall Architecture

### **1. Context-Type Prioritization Matrix**

```typescript
const CONTEXT_TYPES: Record<string, ContextType> = {
  'claude-insight': { priority: 10, baseWeight: 1.0, maxTokens: 200 },
  'bug-fix': { priority: 9, baseWeight: 0.95, maxTokens: 150 },
  'git-commit': { priority: 8, baseWeight: 0.9, maxTokens: 100 },
  'feature-development': { priority: 7, baseWeight: 0.85, maxTokens: 150 },
  'security': { priority: 9, baseWeight: 0.92, maxTokens: 140 },
  'user-request': { priority: 5, baseWeight: 0.7, maxTokens: 100 },
  // ... more types
}
```

**🎯 Result**: Claude's insights get highest priority, critical work gets proper weight, generic content stays in background.

### **2. Multi-Dimensional Relevance Scoring**

**Enhanced Factors** (vs original 5 factors):
- ✨ **Context Type Priority** (40% weight) - NEW: Insights matter most
- 🎯 **Hook Source Intelligence** (20% weight) - NEW: Enhanced vs basic hooks
- 🏷️ **Rich Tag Analysis** (15% weight) - NEW: Complexity/priority/technology scoring
- ⏰ **Smart Recency** (15% weight) - ENHANCED: Slower decay, less dominant
- 🔗 **Work Continuity** (8% weight) - NEW: Relevance to current project/tech/work-type
- 🎛️ **Uniqueness** (2% weight) - ENHANCED: Better deduplication penalty

**🎯 Result**: Context scoring is now **AI-level intelligent** instead of just time-based.

### **3. Intelligent Context Grouping**

**Smart Categories**:
- **🔍 Critical Insights** (5 max) - Claude discoveries, solutions, diagnoses
- **🏗️ Recent Milestones** (8 max) - Git commits, features, bug fixes
- **⚡ Current Work** (10 max) - High-relevance recent context
- **📋 Background** (5 max) - Supporting context

**🎯 Result**: Organized presentation instead of chronological dump.

### **4. Adaptive Token Management**

**Smart Allocation**:
- **40%** to Critical Insights (most valuable)
- **30%** to Recent Milestones (development progress)
- **25%** to Current Work (immediate context)
- **5%** to Background (supporting info)

**🎯 Result**: Never waste tokens on low-value content, always prioritize insights.

### **5. Current Work Context Detection**

**Auto-Detection**:
- **Active Project** - From recent checkpoint project fields
- **Recent Technologies** - From tech-* tags in recent work
- **Current Work Type** - From work type tags (feature-development, bug-fix, etc.)
- **Git Branch** - From current git status
- **Time of Day** - Morning vs afternoon vs late-night context

**🎯 Result**: Relevance scoring adapts to what you're actually working on.

## 🔧 Integration Instructions

### **Option 1: Side-by-Side Testing (Recommended)**
```typescript
// In tool-handlers.ts, add import:
import { handleEnhancedRecall } from "./enhanced-recall-handler.js";

// Add new tool to MCP server registration:
{
  name: "enhanced_recall",
  description: "Restore context with AI-level intelligence",
  inputSchema: RecallSchema
}

// Test both versions, compare results
```

### **Option 2: Full Replacement**
```typescript
// Replace handleRecall with handleEnhancedRecall
// Backup original for rollback if needed
```

### **Option 3: Gradual Migration**
```typescript
// Use enhanced version for certain queries:
// - When search includes "insight", "discovery", "solution"
// - When workspace has rich metadata
// - When token limits are tight
