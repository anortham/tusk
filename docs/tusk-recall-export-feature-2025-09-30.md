🧠 **Context Restored** (deduplication enabled (threshold: 0.7))

   • Enhanced Tusk behavioral instructions with aggressive mid-discussion checkpoint guidance and added export feature to recall tool. Problem: User lost hour-long architectural discussion because agents only checkpoint AFTER completion, not DURING exploration. Hooks capture events but not reasoning/tradeoffs/context. Solution: (1) Rewrote agent-guidance.md to emphasize checkpoint every 5-10 exchanges during discussions with concrete examples, frequency rules, and urgency messaging about context loss. (2) Added export flag to recall tool - `recall({ export: true, exportPath: "docs" })` writes markdown files for discoverability and grep-ability. Addresses SQLite opacity problem where data exists but isn't browsable. (main) [tusk, feature, behavioral-instructions, export, context-survival, critical] (0m ago)

📤✨ ADD EXPORT FEATURE: Recall to markdown for discoverability

Problem: SQLite opacity made it impossible to browse/grep journal 
data. Lost hour-long architectural discussions led to frustration 
about data being (main) [git-commit, completion] (1m ago)
