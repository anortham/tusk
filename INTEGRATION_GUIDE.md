# üîß Quick Integration Guide for Enhanced Recall

## üéØ Recommended Approach: Side-by-Side Testing

Add the enhanced recall as a **new tool** alongside the existing one so you can compare and choose the best approach.

### **Step 1: Add Import to tool-handlers.ts**

```typescript
// Add this import at the top of tool-handlers.ts
import { handleEnhancedRecall } from "./enhanced-recall-handler.js";
```

### **Step 2: Add Enhanced Recall Tool to MCP Server**

In `mcp-server.ts`, add the new tool definition:

```typescript
// Add this to the tools array in server.setRequestHandler
{
  name: "enhanced_recall",
  description: "Restore context with AI-level intelligence and smart prioritization",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      days: { type: "number", default: 2 },
      search: { type: "string" },
      project: { type: "string" },
      workspace: { type: "string", default: "current" },
      deduplicate: { type: "boolean", default: true },
      similarityThreshold: { type: "number", default: 0.7 },
      summarize: { type: "boolean", default: false },
      groupBy: { type: "string", default: "chronological" },
      relevanceThreshold: { type: "number", default: 0.0 },
      maxEntries: { type: "number", default: 50 }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Add Tool Handler**

In the tool call handler section of `mcp-server.ts`:

```typescript
case "enhanced_recall":
  return handleEnhancedRecall(request.params.arguments);
```

### **Step 4: Test Both Versions**

Now you can test both:

```bash
# Original recall
/recall --days 7

# Enhanced intelligent recall
/enhanced_recall --days 7
```

## üîç What You'll See

### **Original Recall Output:**
- Chronological list
- All entries equal weight
- Basic filtering
- Simple format

### **Enhanced Recall Output:**
- **Current Context** header with project/branch/tech
- **Critical Insights** section (discoveries, solutions)
- **Recent Milestones** section (commits, features)
- **Current Work** section (relevant recent activities)
- **Smart token management** with summary

## üöÄ Quick Test Commands

Try these to see the difference:

```bash
# Compare basic vs enhanced
/recall --days 3
/enhanced_recall --days 3

# Test search with both
/recall --search "typescript"
/enhanced_recall --search "typescript"

# Test with current work focus
/enhanced_recall --days 1
```

## üìä Expected Experience

You should immediately notice:

1. **Better Organization** - Context grouped by importance
2. **Current Context Awareness** - Shows your project/branch/tech
3. **Priority Intelligence** - Insights surface first
4. **Token Efficiency** - More valuable content in same space
5. **Actionable Format** - Easy to scan and understand

## üéØ Migration Decision

After testing, you can:

### **Option A: Keep Enhanced as Primary**
Replace the original `recall` tool with `enhanced_recall` functionality

### **Option B: Dual Tools**
Keep both - use `recall` for simple chronological lists, `enhanced_recall` for intelligent context restoration

### **Option C: Gradual Migration**
Use enhanced version when certain conditions are met (search terms, workspace type, etc.)

## üîß Easy Rollback

If you want to revert:
1. Remove the enhanced_recall tool from MCP server
2. Remove the import from tool-handlers.ts
3. Everything returns to original state

## üìà Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ Context feels immediately relevant to current work
- ‚úÖ Important insights surface prominently
- ‚úÖ No more scanning through walls of chronological text
- ‚úÖ Current project/tech context is automatically detected
- ‚úÖ Token usage is more efficient with better content

The enhanced system should feel like **having an intelligent assistant** that knows exactly what context you need for your current work! üß†‚ú®
