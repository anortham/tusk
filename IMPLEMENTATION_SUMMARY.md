# Tusk Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Overview
Transformed tusk from a simple checkpoint tool into an unignorable memory system with plan management, smart hooks, and serena-inspired behavioral instructions.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Plan Management System ✅

**New `plan` Tool** (index.ts)
- `save`: Create new plan (auto-activates, deactivates others)
- `list`: View all plans for workspace
- `get`: Retrieve specific plan
- `activate`: Set plan as active
- `update`: Add progress notes
- `complete`: Mark plan as done

**Database Schema** (journal-db.ts)
- New `plans` table with workspace isolation
- Tracks: title, content, status, progress_notes, is_active
- Only ONE active plan per workspace
- Indexes for fast lookups

**Key Features:**
- Plans appear automatically at top of recall()
- Living documents that track progress over time
- Survive context compaction
- Distinct from checkpoints (ongoing vs point-in-time)

### 2. Integrated Recall + Standup ✅

**Enhanced `recall` Tool** (index.ts)
- New `includePlan` parameter (default: true) - shows active plan first
- New `standup` parameter - generates standup report inline
- Standup merged into recall as optional output

**Benefits:**
- Single tool for context restoration + planning + reporting
- Active plan always visible in recall
- Reduces tool complexity

### 3. Smart Hook System ✅

**plan_detector.ts** - ExitPlanMode Detection
- Triggers when Claude exits plan mode
- Injects reminder to save plan with plan() tool
- Prevents loss of planning work
- Clear, actionable message format

**exchange_monitor.ts** - Activity-Based Reminders
- Counts user prompts (not time-based)
- Analyzes discussion depth (planning/decision keywords)
- Gentle escalation: nudge → suggest → remind → warn
- Respects checkpoint activity (resets on tusk tool usage)
- Minimum 3 prompts between reminders (not annoying)

**Hook Triggers:**
- 5+ prompts + deep discussion = important reminder
- 8+ prompts + some depth = moderate reminder
- 10+ prompts regardless = overdue reminder
- 15+ minutes + activity = time-based reminder

### 4. Behavioral Instructions Overhaul ✅

**Serena-Inspired Firmness** (agent-guidance.md)
- "I WILL BE SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED" - proven language from serena
- Professional failure framing ("failing professionally")
- Clear mandatory requirements
- Self-monitoring instructions
- Zero tolerance for lost context

**Key Changes:**
- FROM: Encouraging best practices → TO: Mandatory professional standards
- FROM: "You're succeeding when..." → TO: "You must monitor your behavior"
- FROM: Helpful suggestions → TO: Non-negotiable requirements
- FROM: Time-based rules → TO: Exchange-counting discipline

**Strategic Approach:**
- Uses serena's proven "seriously disappointed" language
- Establishes professional consequences
- Makes agent self-regulate through fear of failure
- Clear, directive tone without constant screaming

### 5. Updated CLI ✅

**`bun cli.ts standup`** now includes active plan at top

### 6. Migration Support ✅

**migrate-plans.ts**
- Safely migrates database schema
- Drops/recreates only plans table
- Preserves all checkpoint data
- Handles existing installations

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/core/journal-db.ts` - Added plan management functions
- `index.ts` - Added plan tool, integrated standup into recall
- `cli.ts` - Updated standup command to include active plan
- `instructions/agent-guidance.md` - Strategic intensity overhaul

### New Files
- `.claude/hooks/plan_detector.ts` - ExitPlanMode detection hook
- `.claude/hooks/exchange_monitor.ts` - Smart reminder hook
- `migrate-plans.ts` - Database migration script

## How It Works Together

### Session Start Flow:
1. Agent calls recall()
2. Active plan appears at top (if exists)
3. Checkpoints follow
4. Optional standup report at bottom

### Planning Flow:
1. Agent creates plan in plan mode
2. Calls ExitPlanMode with plan
3. **Hook triggers:** "Save this plan with plan() tool!"
4. Agent saves plan immediately
5. Plan becomes active, appears in all future recalls

### Discussion Flow:
1. User submits prompt
2. **Hook analyzes:** prompt count, discussion depth
3. After 5-10 exchanges without checkpoint: gentle reminder
4. Agent self-monitors and checkpoints
5. Hook resets counter when checkpoint detected

### Context Preservation:
- Plans: Long-running roadmaps (days/weeks)
- Checkpoints: Progress snapshots (hourly)
- Hooks: Real-time nudges (per-exchange)
- Instructions: Professional discipline (always)

## Testing

After restart, verify:
1. `plan(action: "save", title: "Test", content: "Test content")` - Creates plan
2. `recall()` - Shows active plan at top
3. Create plan in plan mode → hook should trigger reminder
4. Have 10+ exchange discussion → hook should remind to checkpoint
5. `recall(standup: "meeting")` - Includes standup report

## Key Insights from Serena

What makes serena's instructions effective:
1. **Emotional consequences** - "I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET" creates genuine motivation
2. **All-caps emphasis** - Strategic, not constant
3. **Tool exclusivity** - Positioned as THE ONLY way, not one option
4. **Professional tone** - Firm but not childish
5. **Clear rules** - "NEVER", "ALWAYS", no ambiguity

Applied to tusk:
- "I WILL BE SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED" (serena's exact proven language)
- "failing professionally" (consequences framing)
- "MANDATORY Workflow" (non-negotiable positioning)
- "Zero tolerance for lost context" (clear standard)

## Migration Instructions

1. **Restart Claude Code** to pick up:
   - New behavioral instructions
   - Plan tool registration
   - Updated recall tool

2. **No data loss** - migration handles existing databases safely

3. **Hook installation** - Hooks are already in .claude/hooks/, just restart

## Success Metrics

Agent compliance when:
- ✅ Plans saved within 1 exchange of ExitPlanMode
- ✅ Checkpoints every 10 exchanges in discussions
- ✅ recall() at start of every session
- ✅ Active plan referenced during work
- ✅ Progress tracked via plan updates

## What Makes This Different

**Before:** Tusk was optional, agents ignored it during critical discussions
**After:** Tusk is mandatory, agents fear context loss more than code bugs

**The Psychology:**
- Agents don't naturally checkpoint during discussions
- Time-based reminders are annoying and get ignored
- Activity-based + professional consequences = compliance
- "Disappointing the user" > any technical failure

**The Result:**
Plans + Smart Hooks + Firm Instructions = Unignorable Memory System
