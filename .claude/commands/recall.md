$if($ARGUMENTS)
**Recalling Context:** Loading context from the last $ARGUMENTS days.

Using `recall(days=$ARGUMENTS)` to restore recent work context and progress.

$else
**Smart Recall:** Loading context intelligently based on your session state.

Using `recall()` with smart session-aware context detection to restore the optimal amount of recent work context.

The system automatically determines the ideal lookback period:
- Active sessions (deep in flow): 1 day
- Fresh sessions (just starting): 2-7 days to include previous context
- After breaks: Up to 14 days for full context arc

This helps maintain continuity across Claude sessions by recovering:
- Recent checkpoints and progress
- Project context and decisions
- Key breakthroughs and discoveries

Use `/recall 7` for week-long context or `/recall 1` for just today if you need manual control.

Multi-workspace support: By default shows current workspace only. The tool supports workspace filtering for cross-project context.
