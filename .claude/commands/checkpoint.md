$if($ARGUMENTS)
Save checkpoint: $ARGUMENTS

This will use `checkpoint(action="save", description="$ARGUMENTS")` to preserve your current work context, progress, and key decisions.

This checkpoint will be searchable and can be recalled in future sessions to restore context.

$else
Save a checkpoint using `checkpoint(action="save", description="...")`.

Please describe what you've been working on or what significant progress/decisions should be captured.

Example: `/checkpoint "Completed user authentication system with OAuth2 integration"`

Checkpoints help maintain context across sessions and preserve important work milestones.
